*   ⚠️ Issues Found: Uninitialized variables and dead code.
*   Semantics not preserved: `t1` and `t4` are used uninitialized, leading to undefined behavior.
*   Further: Eliminate dead code: `t0`, `t2`, `t3` assignments and `PUSH_PARAM t1`.
*   Further: Resolve missing function name in `CALL` (or remove if unused).
