*   Semantics preserved.
*   No unsafe optimizations.
*   Remove dead temporaries (e.g., t0, t1).
*   Eliminate DECLARE statements and assignments for a, b, c, d if not externally observable.
*   Remove t13 = CALL , 1 as its result is unused.
✅ Optimization Correct

$Optimization:$
FUNCTION main:
  t12 = "Hello"
  PUSH_PARAM t12
  CALL , 1
  RETURN 8
END FUNCTION main
