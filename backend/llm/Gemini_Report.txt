✅ Optimization Correct
- Semantics preserved; all constant folding and copy propagation are correct.
- No unsafe optimizations identified (assuming integer arithmetic for division).
- Suggest: Eliminate all temporary variables (`t0` through `t11`).
- Suggest: Eliminate `DECLARE x`, `DECLARE y`, `DECLARE z` as they are unused.
- Suggest: Reduce function body to `RETURN 24`.
✅ Optimization Correct

$Optimization:$
FUNCTION main:
  RETURN 24
END FUNCTION main
