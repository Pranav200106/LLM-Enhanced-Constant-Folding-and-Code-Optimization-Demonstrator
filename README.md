# NeuroFold: LLM-Enhanced Code Optimizer

**NeuroFold** is an innovative, AI-assisted compiler optimization project that combines a traditional C-based compiler with a powerful Large Language Model (LLM) to enhance constant folding and overall code optimization. The system intelligently identifies constant expressions, performs compile-time simplifications, and leverages the Gemini LLM to validate semantic correctness and suggest further safe optimizations.

## ✨ Features

- **Automated Code Optimization**: Simply paste your C code into the web interface and get an optimized version in seconds.
- **Constant Folding**: The C-based optimizer automatically identifies and evaluates constant expressions at compile time.
- **LLM-Powered Analysis**: The optimized code is reviewed by the Gemini LLM, which verifies semantic correctness and suggests additional improvements.
- **Interactive UI**: A user-friendly web interface built with React and Tailwind CSS allows you to easily input code and view the results.
- **Detailed Feedback**: The UI displays the optimized code, the LLM's suggestions, and a summary of the optimization status.

## 🚀 How It Works

The project is divided into a frontend, a backend, and a C-based compiler/optimizer. Here's a high-level overview of the workflow:

1.  **Code Submission**: The user enters C code into the React-based frontend and clicks "Optimize."
2.  **Backend Processing**: The code is sent to a Flask backend, which saves it to a `source.c` file.
3.  **Compilation**: The backend invokes a C-based compiler, which performs lexical analysis, parsing, and semantic analysis to generate an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
4.  **Intermediate Code Generation**: The compiler generates three-address code (TAC) from the AST and saves it to `IR.txt`.
5.  **Optimization**: A separate C-based optimizer reads `IR.txt`, performs constant folding, and writes the optimized TAC to `Output.txt`.
6.  **LLM Review**: The optimized TAC is sent to the Gemini API, which reviews the code for semantic correctness and suggests further optimizations.
7.  **Results Display**: The backend sends the optimized code, LLM suggestions, and status back to the frontend, where it is displayed to the user.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm
- Python and pip
- A C compiler (like GCC)
- A Gemini API key

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/LLM-Enhanced-Constant-Folding-and-Code-Optimization-Demonstrator.git
    cd LLM-Enhanced-Constant-Folding-and-Code-Optimization-Demonstrator
    ```

2.  **Install frontend dependencies**:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Install backend dependencies**:
    ```bash
    cd ../backend
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Compile the C code**:
    ```bash
    cd compiler
    gcc -o compiler compiler.c
    gcc -o optimizer optimizer.c
    ```

5.  **Set up environment variables**:
    - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory.
    - Add your Gemini API key to the `.env` file:
      ```
      GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
      ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the backend server**:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    python app.py
    ```

2.  **Start the frontend development server**:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm run dev
    ```

3.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to use the application.
